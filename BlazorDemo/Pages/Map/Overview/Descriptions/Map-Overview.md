Use the DevExpress Blazor [Map](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMap) component to display a geographical map with markers and routes. The component retrieves its data from the GIS service specified by the [Provider](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMap.Provider) property. To authenticate your map application, assign an API key to a corresponding [DxMapApiKeys](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMapApiKeys) property.

Based on selected [map type](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMap.Type), the component displays a road, satellite, or hybrid map. You can also [center](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMapCenter) the map at a specific location and specify the component's [zoom level](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMap.Zoom).
