DevExpress Blazor [Map](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMap) component allows you to calculate and display a [route](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMapMarker) between two or more map locations. Driving and walking [route modes](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMapRoute.Mode) are available.

To create a route, you must:

1. Add a [DxMapRoute](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMapRoute) object to the [route collection](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMapRoutes) and specify the route [mode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMapRoute.Mode).
2. Use a [DxMapRouteLocations](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMapRouteLocations) component to create a list of [map locations](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMapRouteLocation).
3. *Optional*. Customize route [color](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMapRoute.Color), [weight](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMapRoute.Weight), and [transparency](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxMapRoute.Opacity).

This demo uses drop-down menus to change route mode and color.
