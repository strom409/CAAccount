Our Blazor [Range Selector](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxRangeSelector) component supports a `Discrete` [scale type](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxRangeSelectorScale.Type) and allows you to select a range of string values (categories). The component determines scale type based on assigned data source type. To change scale type, use the [DxRangeSelectorScale.Type](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxRangeSelectorScale.Type) property.

In this demo, the Range Selector uses a nested [DxRangeSelectorChart](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxRangeSelectorChart) object to display a chart with bars (where each bar corresponds to a country's population). When you change the range, the component raises the [DxRangeSelector.ValueChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxRangeSelector.ValueChanged) event and calculates total population based on selected countries.
