The DevExpress Blazor [Polar Chart](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxPolarChart-1) component allows you to display data as a polygon graph and render the chart as a "spider web". To enable this functionality, set the [UseSpiderWeb](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxPolarChart-1.UseSpiderWeb) property to `true`.

Use the drop-down menu to change series type.
