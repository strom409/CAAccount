The DevExpress Blazor [Polar Chart](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxPolarChart-1) component allows you to display data as a circular graph. This demo uses a [line series](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxPolarChartLineSeries-3) to display data. Note that this series extrapolates lines whenever arguments are numeric or date-time. Note the curve in the shape of a petalled flower which is commonly known as a "rose" or "rhodonea".

This demo also customizes argument axis — changes direction to counterclockwise (the [Inverted](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartAxisBase-1.Inverted) property is set to `true`) and modifies the [start angle](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxPolarChartArgumentAxis.StartAngle).
