The DevExpress Blazor [Sparkline](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSparkline) component allows you to display value trends using a compact UI metaphor. The [Type](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSparkline.Type) property defines sparkline type.

You can use the DevExpress Blazor Sparkline as a standalone component or embed it into other DevExpress Blazor UI controls. This demo renders sparklines within grid cells and customizes sparkline settings in the following manner:

* Sets colors for different [series types](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSparkline#series).
* Customizes [series points](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSparkline#series-points).
* Configures [tooltip settings](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSparkline#tooltips).

Use the drop-down menu to change series type as needs dictate.
