The DevExpress [Sankey](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSankey) for Blazor depicts value flow between two entity sets and ships with the following built-in capabilities:

* Configurable [nodes](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSankey#nodes) and [links](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSankey#links) 
* Customizable [node labels](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSankey#labels) 
* User interaction options ([hover](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSankey#hover) and [clicks](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSankey#click)) 
* [Export and printing](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSankey#export-and-printing) support 
* Sankey element customization: [title, subtitle](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSankey#title-and-subtitle), and [tooltips](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSankey#tooltips). 

The component obtains values from a data source (the [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSankey.Data) property) and displays them as source and target nodes connected with links. To create nodes and links, specify [SourceFieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSankey.SourceFieldName), [TargetFieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSankey.TargetFieldName), and [WeightFieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSankey.WeightFieldName) properties.
