This demo illustrates how to use [Stock](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartStockSeries-3) series within the [DxChart](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChart-1) component. Stock series display stock price changes over a period of time. The vertical line's bottom and top values indicate high and low prices. Left and right tick marks indicate open and close prices.

In this demo, you can also specify whether the Chart component displays only workdays or all weekdays on the argument axis. Enable the [WorkdaysOnly](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartArgumentAxis.WorkdaysOnly) property to display only workdays specified by the [WorkWeek](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartArgumentAxis.WorkWeek) property. You can also use [WorkDates](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartArgumentAxis.WorkDates) and [Holidays](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChartArgumentAxis.Holidays) properties to mark select weekend dates as workdays or work week dates as holidays.
