The DevExpress Blazor [Ribbon](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxRibbon) component leverages a tabbed toolbar UI metaphor to organize command items across different tabs. This component simplifies access to functions built to improve Ribbon organization and the overall user experience.

Our Blazor Ribbon ships with the following capabilities:

**Application Button**
Like the Microsoft Office Ribbon, our Ribbon includes an Application Button, providing quick access to common functions in a dropdown.

**Support for Multiple Built-in Editors**
The Ribbon supports various editor types, such as buttons, text boxes, combo boxes, color pickers, and spin editors. This improves code structure and efficiency.

**Advanced Adaptivity**
The Ribbon features flexible adaptivity. Each group has an ellipsis button and can collapse into a compressed state.

**Contextual Tabs**
The Ribbon includes contextual tabs that appear dynamically based on the user's actions or selection. These tabs display relevant commands and tools tailored to the current task or content, enhancing user experience and streamlining workflow.
