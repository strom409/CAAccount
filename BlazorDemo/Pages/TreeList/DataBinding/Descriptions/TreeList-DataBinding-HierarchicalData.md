You can bind the DevExpress Blazor TreeList to hierarchical data structures. To bind hierarchical data structures, you must specify the following properties:

* [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeList.Data) — A data source.
* [ChildrenFieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeList.ChildrenFieldName) — A field that contains a node's children.

This demo binds the TreeList component to the `SpaceObject` collection. Each space object can include child items.
