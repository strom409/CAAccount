The DevExpress Blazor TreeList allows users to filter data as their needs dictate. The [FilterTreeMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeList.FilterTreeMode) property specifies how the TreeList component displays filtered nodes:

*   `EntireBranch` — The component displays a node that meets the filter criteria and all its parent and child nodes, even if they do not meet the criteria.
*   `Nodes` — The component ignores parent-child relationships and displays all nodes that meet the filter criteria at one level.
*   `ParentBranch` — The component displays a node that meets the filter criteria and all its parent nodes, even if they do not meet the criteria.
*   `Auto` (default) — The filter tree mode depends on the bound data source. When bound to a [GridDevExtremeDataSource\<T>](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.GridDevExtremeDataSource-1), the TreeList component switches to the `Nodes` mode to improve performance. In other data binding scenarios, the TreeList operates in `ParentBranch` mode.

Enable the [ShowFilterRow](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeList.ShowFilterRow) property to activate the integrated DevExpress TreeList Filter Row (displays in-place editors for all data columns). When a user enters a value into an editor, the TreeList creates a filter condition based on the value and applies this condition to the corresponding column.

You can use the following column properties to customize filter row behavior: 
* [FilterRowOperatorType](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeListDataColumn.FilterRowOperatorType) — Specifies an operator used to create a filter condition based on the filter row value. If you do not define this option, our Blazor TreeList chooses the operator type automatically: `Contains` for columns bound to [string](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string) data types; `Equal` for all others.
* [FilterRowValue](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeListDataColumn.FilterRowValue) — Specifies the initial value in the filter row editor. If you define this property, you should also specify the [FilterRowOperatorType](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeListDataColumn.FilterRowOperatorType) property.
* [FilterRowEditorVisible](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeListDataColumn.FilterRowEditorVisible) — Specifies whether to display the filter row editor.

The TreeList allows you to customize filter row editors in the following manner:

* Declare and customize editor settings in a column's [EditSettings](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeListDataColumn.EditSettings) property markup.
* Handle the [CustomizeFilterRowEditor](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeList.CustomizeFilterRowEditor) event to modify editor settings at runtime.
* Create [FilterRowCellTemplate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeListDataColumn.FilterRowCellTemplate) to implement custom filter row cell content.

In this demo, settings for the **Assigned To** and **Priority** columns are modified to display values from external collections for the filter row/data rows. The [FilterRowCellTemplate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeListDataColumn.FilterRowCellTemplate) property implements the filter editor for the **Progress** column.
