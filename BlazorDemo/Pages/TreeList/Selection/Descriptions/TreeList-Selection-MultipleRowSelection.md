The DevExpress Blazor TreeList supports both single and multiple row selection. To compare and identify data items, the TreeList uses primary keys assigned to the [KeyFieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeList.KeyFieldName) property. If this property is not set, the TreeList uses [standard .NET value equality comparison](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/equality-comparisons) to identify data items.

Use our Blazor TreeList's built-in selection column to simplify row selection. To display this column, declare a [DxTreeListSelectionColumn](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeListSelectionColumn) object in the [Columns](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeList.Columns) template.

Enable the [AllowSelectRowByClick](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeList.AllowSelectRowByClick) option to select rows via mouse clicks. Users can use Ctrl+Click and Shift+Click combinations to select/deselect individual rows or ranges.

In this demo, users can select multiple rows (the [SelectionMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeList.SelectionMode) property is set to `Multiple` — the default value). The **Select All** check box within the selection column's header selects/deselects all rows displayed on the current page. The [SelectedDataItems](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTreeList.SelectedDataItems) property is used to access selected items and display information about them next to the TreeList.
