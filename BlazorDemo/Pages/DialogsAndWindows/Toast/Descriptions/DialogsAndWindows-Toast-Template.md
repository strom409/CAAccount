A toast notification can include templates (render fragments). This content is displayed below toast title and text if visible, or occupies the entire toast body if it does not include text.

This demo contains three [DxToast](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxToast) components defined in markup. Each toast includes child content that is rendered as a template. Click a button to call the [Show](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxToast.Show) method and display a toast.
