The Blazor [Search Box](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSearchBox) component can be used to introduce ad-hoc search capabilities in your next DevExpress-powered Blazor app.

Use the [Text](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSearchBox.Text) property to specify a search text string or to bind the component to a data source object. To respond to text changes, handle the [TextChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxSearchBox.TextChanged) event. You can also use the `@bind` attribute (@bind-Text) to implement two-way binding as requirements dictate.

Our Blazor Search Box component supports different size modes. To specify the component size in code, use the [SizeMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxDataEditor-1.SizeMode) property. To apply different size modes in this demo, use the drop-down list in the demo card's header.
