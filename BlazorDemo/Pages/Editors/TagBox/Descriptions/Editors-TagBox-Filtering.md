Our Blazor [TagBox](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTagBox-2) allows you to introduce search and filter capabilities via the following API members:

* [SearchMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxDropDownListEditorBase-2.SearchMode) — Specifies whether the component can search for text based on user input (within the edit box).
* [SearchFilterCondition](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxDropDownListEditorBase-2.SearchFilterCondition) — Specifies the search and filter condition (**Contains** or **StartsWith**).
* [SearchTextParseMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxDropDownListEditorBase-2.SearchTextParseMode) — Specifies how the component treats search words. If search text contains multiple words separated by space characters, words can be treated as a single condition or individual conditions. The following text parse modes are available: **GroupWordsByAnd**, **GroupWordsByOr**, and **ExactMatch**.
