The [TagBox](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTagBox-2) is an editor that allows users to select multiple items (tags) from a predefined drop-down list. Users can also type in the edit box to filter list items that contain the search string. 

The main TagBox API members are listed below:

*   [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxListEditorBase-2.Data) — Specifies the data source that populates the editor's list items.
*   [TextFieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxListEditorBase-2.TextFieldName) — Specifies the data source's field that supplies text for items.
*   [Tags](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTagBox-2.Tags) — Specifies the editor's tags.
*   [TagsChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTagBox-2.TagsChanged) — Fires when the tag collection is changed.
*   [Values](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTagBox-2.Values) — Specifies the drop-down list's selected values.
*   [ValuesChanged](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTagBox-2.ValuesChanged) — Fires when the selected value collection is changed.

The TagBox component supports different size modes. To specify the component's size in code, use the [SizeMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxEditorBase.SizeMode) property. To apply different size modes, use the drop-down list in the demo card's header.

The TagBox supports keyboard navigation ([list of supported keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxTagBox-2#keyboard-navigation)), allowing users to navigate within the item list and select tags.

This demo illustrates how to bind the TagBox to a list of complex business objects.
