Our Blazor [ComboBox](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxComboBox-2) ships with API members that allow you to search and apply filters to list content:

* [SearchMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxDropDownListEditorBase-2.SearchMode) — Specifies whether the component can search for text users enter within the edit box.
* [SearchFilterCondition](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxDropDownListEditorBase-2.SearchFilterCondition) — Specifies the search and filter condition (**Contains** or **StartsWith**).
* [SearchTextParseMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxDropDownListEditorBase-2.SearchTextParseMode) — Specifies how the component treats search words. If search text contains multiple words separated by space characters, words can be treated as a single condition or individual conditions. The following modes are available: **GroupWordsByAnd**, **GroupWordsByOr**, and **ExactMatch**.
