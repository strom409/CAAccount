Use the [DisabledFieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxListEditorBase-2.DisabledFieldName) property to disable individual items within a List Box.  The property specifies a Boolean field and stores each item's enabled or disabled state. Disabled items are grayed out and cannot be selected.

**Note:** Disabled items can improve overall usability but cannot replace appropriate security protocols (Users may still be able to select disabled items on the client side – as such, you should implement appropriate security-related checks in code).
