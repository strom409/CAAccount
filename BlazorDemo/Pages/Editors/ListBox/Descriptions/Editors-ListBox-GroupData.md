To help you deliver the best possible user experience, our Blazor List Box allows you to organize its list items into groups.

Use the [GroupFieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.Base.DxListEditorBase-2.GroupFieldName) property to group data within our Blazor List Box (Group field values appear as group headers the list).

Note the following when using this option:

* The List Box supports a single group level.
* Users cannot collapse groups.
* Group headers are not used for search operations.
* Multi-column List Box controls also support groups.
* You can use the [GroupHeaderDisplayTemplate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxListBox-2.GroupHeaderDisplayTemplate) property to customize group headers.
