This demo illustrates the possibilities available to you when binding to a remote data source and using the DevExpress Blazor Grid’s built-in data export functionality. When a user initiates an export operation, our Blazor Grid displays a loading indicator, fetches records from the data source, and generates the exported document. To avoid screen flicker, the indicator only appears if the component expects a time-consuming operation.

Refer to the following help topic for additional information: [Blazor Grid - Export Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/404338/components/grid/export).
