Use the [UploadMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxFileInput.UploadMode) property to specify how the File Input component uploads files:

* `Instant` (Default) — The component starts uploading a file once a user selects or drops it.
* `OnButtonClick` — The component starts uploading a file once a user clicks an upload button.

In this demo, the File Input component uses `OnButtonClick` upload mode.
