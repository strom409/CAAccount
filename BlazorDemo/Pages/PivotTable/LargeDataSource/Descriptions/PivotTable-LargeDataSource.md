This demo showcases the Pivot Table's performance with thousands of rows. The Pivot Table efficiently aggregates large data sources and allows users to navigate and sort data seamlessly.
 
Use the Pivot Table's virtual scrolling option to improve performance against large datasets. When the [VirtualScrollingEnabled](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.PivotTable.DxPivotTable.VirtualScrollingEnabled) property is set to `true`, the DevExpress Blazor Pivot Table renders data on demand as users scroll through rows/columns.
