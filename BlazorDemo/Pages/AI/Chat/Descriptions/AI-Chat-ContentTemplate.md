<div class="alert dxbl-alert alert-primary" role="alert">Note: AI services used for this demo have been rate limited. As such, you may experience performance-related delays when exploring the capabilities of DevExpress AI-powered Extensions.
<br />When connected to your own AI model/service without rate limits, DevExpress AI-powered Extensions will perform seamlessly, without artificial delays.</div>

AI services use plain text as the default response format. To display rich formatted responses within our Blazor Chat component ([DxAIChat](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.AIIntegration.Blazor.Chat.DxAIChat)), set the [ResponseContentFormat](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.AIIntegration.Blazor.Chat.DxAIChat.ResponseContentFormat) property to `Markdown` and use a markdown processor to convert response content to HTML code.

In this demo, the [MessageContentTemplate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.AIIntegration.Blazor.Chat.DxAIChat.MessageContentTemplate) property is used to render HTML code for message bubble content.
