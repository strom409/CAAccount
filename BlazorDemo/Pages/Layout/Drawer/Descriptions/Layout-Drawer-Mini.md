The Drawer component can display a minimized panel when the full-size panel is closed. The panel changes width instead of closing. Use this feature to save space while enabling single-click access to embedded commands. To enable minimized mode, set the [MiniModeEnabled](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDrawer.MiniModeEnabled) property to `true`.

You can use the [MiniPanelWidth](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDrawer.MiniPanelWidth) property to specify the width of the minimized panel.
