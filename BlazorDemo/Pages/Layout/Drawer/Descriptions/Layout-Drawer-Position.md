The Drawer component allows you to specify display location and define how the component interacts with the target content area.

* Use the [Position](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDrawer.Position) property to specify where the drawer panel is displayed – to the left or right of target content.
* Use the [Mode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxDrawer.Mode) property to specify how the drawer panel interacts with the target content area: overlaps or shrinks content.
