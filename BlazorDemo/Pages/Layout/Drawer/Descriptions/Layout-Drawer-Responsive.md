The Drawer component allows you to create adapted layouts (for different screen form factors). In this demo, we use the [DxLayoutBreakpoint](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxLayoutBreakpoint) component to adapt page layout to small screens. When the screen is extra small, the corresponding breakpoint is activated, and the Drawer component changes its settings.

* On small screens, the Drawer is initially hidden and overlaps view content.
* On large screens, the Drawer is initially visible and shrinks view content.
