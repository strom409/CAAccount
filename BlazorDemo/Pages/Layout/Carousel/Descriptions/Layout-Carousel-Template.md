DevExpress [Carousel](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCarousel) for Blazor can display slides (items) with custom content. Populate the component's [Items](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCarousel.Items) property with [DxCarouselItem](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxCarouselItem) objects to create a custom item collection.

In this demo, Carousel items render different series types of the [DxChart](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxChart-1) component.
