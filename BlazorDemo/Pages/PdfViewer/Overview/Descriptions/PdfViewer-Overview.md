The DevExpress Blazor [PDF Viewer](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.PdfViewer.DxPdfViewer) can display a PDF document directly in your DevExpress-powered Blazor application. The component allows you to navigate through individual pages, set zoom level, print the document, and download the file. 
 
The PDF Viewer supports [single-page preview](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.PdfViewer.DxPdfViewer.IsSinglePagePreview) functionality and allows you to access and modify its built-in toolbar using the [CustomizeToolbar](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.PdfViewer.DxPdfViewer.CustomizeToolbar) event.
 
This demo uses a [DxFileInput](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxFileInput) component to upload PDF files.
